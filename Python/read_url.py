"""
Generic reader for internet URLs

This takes a url as input and tries to give output if it can otherwise throws an error. It stores downloaded data in a
directory called '.cache' so that it doesn't have to download the same data again if it hasn't changed.

You can enter a url (standalone mode) or call it from a program and it will return a tuple containing headers and body
decoded as per the encoding supplied in the input. Encoding defaults to utf-8. If there is an error it will return False
so you chould check for this.

Usage:

1. Standalone mode:
    Enter the URL and encoding at the appropriate prompts.

2. You can also import this into your programs:
    import read_url
    result = read_url.get_url(your_url, your_encoding)

    --or--

    from read_url import get_url
    result = get_url(your_url, your_encoding)
